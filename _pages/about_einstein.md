Hi! Nice to meet you (virtually)! I am an aspiring ML researcher who is currently pursuing a CompSci specialist and Mathematics major double degree with a focus in AI at UofT (year 3). My passion revolves around `computer vision`, `graphics`, and `neural fields`. In particular, I'm interested in helping the field understand the inner workings of implicit neural representation and how it could contribute to its downstream applications. I'm currently supervised by Professor David Lindell at the Toronto Computational Imaging Group.

Besides research, I also find joy in sharing my experiences through leadership. From founding my high school's first student-led team, the [AI Project Group](https://github.com/spccaipg/), to being the vice president of the [UofT Machine Intelligence Student Team](https://utmist.gitlab.io/), I have always loved to explore the broader perspectives of AI through collaboration with liked-minded peers.
