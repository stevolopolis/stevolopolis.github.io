Hi! Nice to meet you (virtually)! I am an aspiring ML researcher who is currently pursuing a CompSci specialist at University of Toronto (year 3). My research interest revolves around `computer vision`, `graphics`, and `neural fields`. 

My ML journey started with explorations into computer vision back in 2018, a time when state of the art was still mainly CNNs. Since then, Iâ€™ve worked on numerous projects related to object classification (lip reading), detection (real-time hand gesture detection), generation (font style transfer & single-eye face generation). When I came to UofT, I decided to take a quick detour into the cross-section of computer vision and neuroscience. At the UTSC CoNSens Lab, I developed a novel classification/detection model analogous to the ventral/dorsal streams of the human brain. We would use explainability methods like guided backprop to understand the feature detectors in the network and draw correlations to the detectors found in a biological brain. In 2023, I went back to pure ML research and found a passion in neural fields and 3D graphics. With my colleagues at the University of Hong Kong, we developed a novel method that utilizes the underlying patterns of a neural fields activations to reduce asymptotic inferences costs of implicit neural fields by up to 300x. Orthogonal to implicit neural fields are its explicit counterparts such as Instant-NGP, which are state-of-the-art methods for 3D representations but are very poorly understood. This led to my current work with Professor David Lindell at the University of Toronto where I am developing a framework for quantifying the expressivities of grid-based neural fields. This would hopefully serve as a heuristic for explaining the effectiveness of these neural fields and aid our selections of the network configurations.

Besides research, I also find joy in sharing my experiences through leadership. From founding my high school's first student-led team, the [AI Project Group](https://github.com/spccaipg/), to being the vice president of the [UofT Machine Intelligence Student Team](https://utmist.gitlab.io/), I have always loved to explore the broader perspectives of AI through collaboration with liked-minded peers.
